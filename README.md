If you've found this repository by chance, welcome.

If you are going to do the same course with the same project and you intend to use it as your own, don't even think about it: even if it is publicly exposed on the Internet, it doesn't mean you can plagiarize it and use it as your own. Teachers are not stupid. 

Furthermore, this project is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). 

*TL;DR: You can modify it, as long as you keep the same license, don't use it commercially and attribute it correctly to its authors.*

However, feel free to take inspiration and ideas.
